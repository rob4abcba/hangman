# RL If I have time, I might use this as a starting point to create a "Guess the pinyin" for the displayed Chinese characters hangman style game.  Notice I said "hangman style" not "Gangman style" LOL

Display a Chinese character.
The learner/player enters one-by-one the letters that spell out the pinyin for that Chinese character/word.
For each Chinese character/syllable, The learner/player enters 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 to denote untoned plus the 4 tones.
0 = untoned
1 = high tone
2 = rising tone
3 = falling then rising tone
4 = sharp falling tone
